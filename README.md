Advanced Explorations in Machine Learning (CS771) Guide: Prof. Purushottam Kar  (Aug’22-Nov’22)
◦ DeCAPTCHA : Character Recognition System
◦ Implemented erosion and dilation filters with carefully chosen parameters to expertly segment characters, aligning
with the problem statement’s requirements through image processing.
◦ Employed techniques for accurate background removal and character identification within CAPTCHA images.
◦ Transformed string labels into integer representations using LabelEncoder, followed by one-hot encoding for
improved data representation.
◦ The Code Corrector : Automated Program Repair
◦ Explored several of classification techniques, Logistic Regression (OvA), LWP, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
◦ Opted for Logistic Regression (OvA) due to its robustness in handling imbalanced data, accuracy and reliability.
◦ Addressed imbalanced data challenges by systematically adjusting class weights, leading to notable improvements.
◦ Employed techniques like SMOTE and Hybrid Sampling to enhance performance, achieving macro precision.
◦ Conducted thorough hyperparameter tuning through grid search to achieve finely optimized model parameters.
◦ XOR PUF Response Predictor:
◦ Integrated a novel algorithm named "The XOR-PUF Analyzer" to enhance understanding of XOR-PUF systems.
◦ Conceptualized the problem as a linear regression challenge, utilizing mathematical derivations and innovative
machine learning techniques to predict individual PUF outputs within the XOR-PUF architecture.
◦ To deepen the comprehension of algorithmic mechanics, engineered a custom linear regression algorithm.
◦ Conducted rigorous hyperparameter tuning through grid search to fine-tune model parameters for optimal prediction
of XOR-PUF outputs.
